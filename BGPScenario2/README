This project describes a transit AS (could be a small ISP) that serves one customer and has two upstream links to two ISPs.

Components:

- The transit AS, with value 500, consists of four routers: R1, R2, R3 and R4. 

- The CUST is using a private AS of value 64512.

- ISP1 is in AS 100.

- ISP2 is in AS 200.

Details:

- Transit AS 500:
 -- Consists of 4 routers running OSPF as the IGW and iBGP between each other (full mesh topology between the iBGP routers - in terms of neighborship).

- ISP1 - AS 100:
 -- Connected to AS 500 by running eBGP with R1.
 -- Loopback interfaces 0-5 represent outside networks that ISP1 is advertising to AS 500 via the redistribute command.

- ISP2 - AS 200:
-- Connected to AS 500 by running eBGP with R2.
-- Loopback interfaces 0-5 represent outside networks that ISP2 is advertising to AS 500 via the redistribute command.

- CUST - AS 64512:
 -- Connected to AS 500 by running eBGP with R3.
 -- Network 160.0.0.0/24 is the network the customer wants to advertise to the rest of the world.

Recommended commands to run, in privileged mode, to get more information about the topology:

- On the routers in AS 500:
 -- show ip ospf neighbor
 -- show ip bgp neighbors
 -- show ip bgp
 -- show ip route
 -- show running-config | s router ospf
 -- show running-config | s router bgp

- On the rest of the routers in the topology:
 -- show ip bgp neighbors
 -- show ip bgp
 -- show ip route
 -- show running-config | s router bgp
