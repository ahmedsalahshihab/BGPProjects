Identical to project BGPScenario2. The only difference is that instead of having a full mesh topology, in terms of neighborship, between R1-4, we create two confederations and peer them with each other:

- Confederation 64513 consists of routers R1 and R3.
- Confederation 64514 consists of routers R2 and R4.
