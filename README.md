 Folder BGPProjects contains 5 folders. In each folder you will find a README file that describes its content. I recommend going through the folders in the following order:

- BGPScenario1
- BGPScenario2
- PlayingwithBGPscenario2
- RouteReflectors
- Confederation

Note:

To be able to view any project in this folder, you need to do the below:

- Download and install GNS3. You can download it from https://www.gns3.com/software/download. 
- Import the Cisco c7200 appliance and download its image. You can import the appliance by following https://docs-v1.gns3.com/1_3RdgLWgfk4ylRr99htYZrGMoFlJcmKAAaUAc8x9Ph8/index.html and download the image file from here https://mega.nz/file/YUYU0C6Y#mlAaugGWoEBIKRRWhBhLG1vJiIP6OtgR-Rev4COWHNw. When importing the appliance, you can follow the guide or just select "Install the appliance on your local computer" like I did.
